# Change log

All notable changes to the project will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## [1.7.1] - 2022-05-10
### Fixed:
- In the SSE server implementation, removed string concatenation logic that caused writing of large messages to be unnecessarily memory-intensive. (Thanks, [moshegood](https://github.com/launchdarkly/eventsource/pull/35)!)
- The SSE server implementation did not correctly write a message if the data field was empty: it dropped the field entirely, which would cause clients not to read the message.

## [1.7.0] - 2022-01-05
This release includes improvements for SSE spec compliance that do not affect usage in the LaunchDarkly Go SDK, but may be relevant in other use cases.

### Added:
- Each event returned by the client now includes the last event ID that was seen on this stream (if any), rather than only the ID (if any) that was in that particular event. This is a requirement of the SSE spec. For backward compatibility, `Event.Id()` still has the old behavior of returning only the ID for that event; the new behavior is in a new interface method, `EventWithLastID.LastEventID()`. Every event returned by the client implements both `Event` and `EventWithLastID`.

### Changed:
- CI tests now use the latest `v2` release of https://github.com/launchdarkly/sse-contract-tests.

### Fixed:
- The client should discard any `id:` field that contains a null character, as per the SSE spec.

## [1.6.2] - 2020-12-02
### Fixed:
- Removed extra newline from &#34;Reconnecting in...&#34; log message.

## [1.6.1] - 2020-07-23
### Changed:
- `Server.Handler()` now uses the standard `context.Context` mechanism to detect when a request has been cancelled, instead of the deprecated `http.CloseNotifier`.

## [1.6.0] - 2020-07-23
### Added:
- `Server.Unregister` method for removing a `Repository` registration and optionally forcing clients to disconnect.
- `Server.PublishWithAcknowledgement` method for ensuring that an action does not happen until an event has been dispatched.

### Fixed:
- Fixed a race condition in which `Server` might close a channel while another goroutine is trying to write to it. This would happen if you registered a `Repository` that replays events, started a handler, then closed the `Server` while the events were still replaying.
- Improved unit test coverage.

## [1.5.0] - 2020-07-15
### Added:
- `Server.MaxConnTime` is an optional setting to make the `Server` automatically close any stream connection that has stayed open for at least that amount of time. This may be useful in preventing server instances from accumulating too many connections in a load-balanced environment.

## [1.4.3] - 2020-07-07
### Changed:
- The only changes in this release are to the test dependencies, to avoid bringing in unnecessary transitive dependencies such as `go-sdk-common`. Some of the test dependencies are now modules that can only be used in Go 1.13&#43;, which means that the test build for this project only runs in Go 1.13&#43;, but it can still be imported by projects that use older Go versions.

## [1.4.2] - 2020-06-04
### Added:
- Added `go.mod` so this package can be consumed as a module. This does not affect code that is currently consuming it via `go get`, `dep`, or `govendor`.

## [1.4.1] - 2020-03-27
### Fixed:
- An error in the backoff logic added in v1.4.0 could cause a panic after many successive retries, due to the exponential backoff value exceeding `math.MaxInt64` resulting in a negative number being passed to `random.Int63n`.

## [1.4.0] - 2020-03-25
### Added:
- New option `StreamOptionErrorHandler` provides an alternate way to receive errors and control how `Stream` behaves after an error.
- New `Stream` method `Restart()` provides a way to make the stream reconnect at any time even if it has not detected an error, using the same retry semantics (backoff, jitter, etc.) that have already been configured.

## [1.3.0] - 2020-03-24
### Added:
- New option `StreamOptionUseBackoff` allows `Stream` to be configured to use exponential backoff for reconnections. There was existing logic for exponential backoff, but it was not working, so until now the retry delay was always the same; for backward compatibility with that behavior, the default is still to not use backoff.
- The new option `StreamOptionRetryResetInterval` can be used in conjunction with `StreamOptionUseBackoff` to determine when, if ever, the retry delay can be reset to its initial value rather than continuing to decrease.
- New option `StreamOptionUseJitter` tells `Stream` to subtract a pseudo-random amount from the retry delay.
- New option `StreamOptionCanRetryFirstConnection` tells `Stream` that it can retry the initial connection attempt. Previously, a failed initial connection would be considered a permanent failure.

## [1.2.0] - 2019-06-17
### Added:
- `NewDecoderWithOptions` allows creating a `Decoder` with non-default settings; currently the only such setting is `DecoderOptionReadTimeout`. Normally you will not need to create a `Decoder` directly; it is done automatically by `Stream`.
### Fixed:
- Reverted an unintentional change in v1.1.0 to the signature of the exported function `NewDecoder`.

## [1.1.0] - 2018-10-03
### Added:
- It is now possible to specify a read timeout for a stream. If the stream does not receive new data (either events or comments) within this interval, it will emit an error and restart the connection.
- New stream constructor methods `SubscribeWithURL` and `SubscribeWithRequestAndOptions` allow any combination of optional configuration parameters to be specified for a stream: read timeout, initial retry delay, last event ID, HTTP client, logger.

## [1.0.1] - 2018-07-20
### Fixed:
- Avoid trying to to decode non-200 responses which was generating extra error messages.

## [1.0.0] - 2018-06-14
Initial release of this fork.

### Added:
- Added support for Close() method.
